= Conclusion



It is time to conclude this tutorial.
Hopefully this has been useful to you, and you managed to make your first steps in programming and/or Nim programming language.

These have only been the basics and we've only scratched the surface, but this should be enough to enable you to make simple programs and solve some simple tasks or puzzles.
Nim has a lot more to offer, and hopefully you will continue to explore its possibilities.
